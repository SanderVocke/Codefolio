	  <h3>BBStudio</h3>
	   
      <p style="text-align:left">
		This takes me back... BBStudio was a project I did alone back in high school for coursework. I was interested in graphics, game programming and physics engines, so decided to "roll" my own - literally, because to keep it manageble for myself I limited it to only spherical objects. My basic knowledge of Newtonian physics was enough to get the ball rolling! And I learned a lot in the process.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I added 3D graphics rendering with the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE 3D engine</a> and a UI that allowed the user to design and store small ballular physics experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
		By far the coolest Eureka moment for me: I added the option to define a force toward a fixed point in space, and found out that if applied in combination with initial motion, the spheres actually started following stable elliptical orbits! That to me was awesome, since the physics engine itself was not much more than an implementation of Newton's second law.

	  <h3>Intergalactic</h3>
	  
      <p style="text-align:left">
		Another high-school personal project. This was from even before BBStudio. As I'm sure was true for some other teenagers, my interest in programming stemmed partly from the fantasy of creating my own computer games.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Although the project proved too ambitious for my own attention span, Intergalactic was a pretty cool 3D game. It used the <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">Irrlicht 3D engine</a>. It had two of my own spaceship designs and a castle floating in space (taken directly from a Quake map).
      </p>
      <p>
		The player could fly around in third-person with mouse controls, control the throttle and shoot lasers. You could crash into the castle and explode. Enemies could be spawned - unfortunately, the most sophisticated AI I came up with was for them to fly in circles forever. The climax was being able to "lock on" to an enemy and fire a missile, which would turn towards the target to hit it.

	  <h3>Cuber</h3>
      
      <p style="text-align:left">
		During my BSc period, I got increasingly interested in electronics and microcontrollers, and decided to learn more about it by starting another personal project.
      </p>
      <p>
		Cuber is a 8x8x8 LED cube. The first skill I honed with this project was soldering: getting all those LEDs in place and reliably connected was hard! I went for an ambitious wiring scheme, where one microcontroller (programmed in optimized assembly) was required to rapidly control 128 shift registers and switch power to subsets of LEDs to create the illusion of continuous light. The other controller provided a UI through an LCD screen and buttons, and accepted the serial control stream from a PC.
	  </p>
      <p>I designed the Cuber circuit board in Eagle and etched it myself. It even had a "simulator" on PC which could consume the exact same serial control stream from a virtual serial port as the real Cuber, and showed all the LED states in an OpenGL rendering window. This allowed me to focus on creating cool animations and a 3D Snake game.

	  </p>
	  <p>
		Brap has a HTML5+CSS+Javascript web front-end, PHP+SQLite back-end and a suite of Python scripts for database management. All that together makes for a pretty good web design learning project.

		This coursework project during my MSc program is worth mentioning, because we took it pretty far.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    With three other students, we designed and built a solar-powered rover which could track and follow colored objects. Some of my personal contributions:<br>
		- The design choice to use a 360 degree bubble lens, giving the rover omni-vision.<br>
		- The effort to squeeze every drop of performance from the Raspberry Pi by implementing object segmentation for GPU in OpenGL ES, which is not at all meant to be used for computer vision.<br>
		- The deep-dive into the Pi's memory management abstraction layer to make it possible to do zero-copy streaming from the rover's GPU output over to a control station over WiFi.<br>
		- A Python simulator which we could use to develop the rover's driving behaviour.<br>

	  <h3>Halide for IPU</h3>
      
      <p style="text-align:left">
		<a href="http://halide-lang.org">Halide</a> is an emerging domain-specific language for image processing. It is seeing increasing adoption in the industry - most notably at Google and Adobe.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  During my MSc thesis at Intel's Imaging and Camera Technologies Group (ICG), I extended Halide with a code generation back-end and syntax extensions for Intel's imaging DSPs, which are found in Intel IPU subsystems. In the process, I showed that high-performance code generation from Halide for such targets is feasible.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The project has been, and still is a joy to work on. Halide's relatively low complexity (compared to full-fledged back-end compilers such as LLVM) and high extensibility made for a great way to get acquainted with compiler techniques, code generation and automatic optimization. It has also opened my eyes to domain-specific languages as a solution for the problem of maintaining portable, fast code for increasingly specialized and diverse computing platforms. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The paper I authored about the topic is set to appear in <a href="http://www.acm.org/taco/">ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization</a>. Until it is published, an abridged early version can be found at the <a href="http://repository.tue.nl/866731">TU/e university repository</a>.

      <p style="text-align:left">
		I spent about a year at <a href="http://www.powerbyproxi.com">PowerByProxi</a> in Auckland, New Zealand, working on a new generation of Qi wireless smartphone chargers.
	  </p>
	  <p>That involved getting previous products designed by PowerByProxi to comply to the existing Qi standard, while at the same time expanding its capabilities to include multi-phone charging and free placement.</p>

	  <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20170237296">System and method for power transfer</a></p>
	  <p>The most memorable moment in this pursuit was when I teamed up with a colleague specialized in power transfer circuitry, who had an ambitious idea for controlling AC power flowing through the inductive link. So far, the idea had only worked in circuit simulation, where all signals could be set perfectly to control the phases and amplitudes in the system. After days of pushing, on New Year's Day, we suddenly got the concept running on the real thing - just before I was set to leave for a month-long holiday.</p>
